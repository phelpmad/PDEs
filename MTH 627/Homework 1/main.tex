\subsection*{Problem 1}
Solve a modification of I.2.2: consider 
%%
\begin{eqnarray}
p(x)=p_1(x_1)+5p_2(x_2), q(x)=\max(10 p_1(x_1),p_2(x_2))
\end{eqnarray}
%%
defined for $V=V_1 \times V_2 \ni x=(x_1,x_2)$. Are $p(x),q(x)$ seminorms on $V$. If yes, which is stronger? (Provide appropriate scaling constants). Under what assumptions are they norms?  
%

%
\noindent{\bf Solution:}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Assume that $p_1$ and $p_2$ are seminorms on $V$ (because otherwise we cannot show that $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are seminorms). Then, we compute
	\begin{align*}
		
	\end{align*}
