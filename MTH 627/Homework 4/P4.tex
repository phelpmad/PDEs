\subsection*{Problem 1}
Complete exercises from activity in class on Wednesday, 11/9/22 which asked for a solution $u$ and its finite element approximation $u_h$ for the homogeneous Dirichlet BVP on  $\Omega=(0,1)$ with $h=1/2$ and $f$ given as one of $= 1,sin(\pi x), \delta_{1/2}$.  Plot the solutions (by hand is OK but MATLAB is better), and calculate the $L^2,L^{\infty}$ and energy errors of the solution. (If integrals are difficult, use numerical integration, but describe how). 
\\
Discuss any interesting features you see by connecting these to theory developed in class. Was everything as you expected?  Was the error better or worse than you expected?

\subsection*{Problem 2}
Let $u \in V=H_0^1(\Omega)$. Derive an error estimate for the $L^2$ projection $w$ of $u$ onto Galerkin linear finite element space $V_h$, defined as $(u-w,v_h)=0,\; \forall v_h \in V_h$. 
\\
Derive also an estimate for $v$, the elliptic projection of $u$  onto $V_h$ defined as $a(u-v,v_h)=0, \forall v_h \in V_h$.
